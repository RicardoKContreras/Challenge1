# Challenge1
# Impliment missing code and properties to help perfect the website
use the following user story:

* AS A marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:

    * WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

    * WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

    * WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes

    * WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order

    * WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Notes

* There was NO `alt` text decscribing some of the images for accecessability.

* The languge was `en-us` instead of `en`

* The `title` was below the `link` text that links the `stylesheet`

* There was NO `header` for the `body`

* The `div` needed an `id` for `search-engine-optimization` so that when you click `search engine optimization` on the webpage, the browser goes to that section.

* There was no `footer` element for the footer.

* Organized CSS to be in a semantic structure.

* changed the `title` to Horiseon
